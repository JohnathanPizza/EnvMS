after making changes:

do
$ git status
to see what has changed and what needs to be added to your next commit

add changes with
$ git add <file>

revert changes you made AND DID NOT ADD YET with
$ git restore <file>
revert changes you AND ALREADY ADDED with
$ git restore --cached <file>
(^ i think it tells you to do these in the output of $ git status)

after adding all desired changes to the index, do
$ git commit -m "your very meaningful message"

and then
$ git push

ANY TIME YOU LOG ON AND WANT TO START WORKING ON THE PROJECT:
PLEASE run
$ git pull
FIRST BEFORE YOU START MAKING CHANGES AND MAKING NEW COMMITS
IF YOU MESS IT ALL UP DONT WORRY JUST ASK ME FOR HELP ITS NOT BAD

if you want to see your current changes between the last commit and now do
$ git diff

AND LASTLY IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING OR WANT TO SEE MORE OPTIONS do
$ git help <command>
like
$ git help diff, or $ git help add
